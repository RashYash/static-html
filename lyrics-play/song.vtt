00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.800
And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.700
Where we're gonna be when we turn 25

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.800
Keep thinking times will never change

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.700
Keep on thinking things will always be the same (Be the same)

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.800
But when we leave this year we won't be coming back

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.700
No more hanging out cause we're on a different track

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.500
And if you got something that you need to say

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.900
You better say it right now cause you don't have another day (Another day)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.700
'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.500
These memories are playing like a film without sound

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.600
And I keep thinking of that night in June

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.600
I didn't know much of love, but it came too soon (Came too soon)

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.800
And there was me and you, and then we got real blue

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900
Stay at home talking on the telephone with me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.600
We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.600
And this is how it feels

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.500
As we go on

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.400
We remember

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.500
All the times we

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.500
Had together

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.700
And as our lives change

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.700
Come whatever

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.500
We will still be

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.500
Friends forever

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.600
So if we get the big jobs, and we make the big money

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.600
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.700
Will we still remember everything we learned in school?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
Still be trying to break every single rule (Every rule)

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.500
Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.500
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with a tan?

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.900
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (Goodbye)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.100
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.000
And this is how it feels

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.500
As we go on

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.400
We remember

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.500
All the times we

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.400
Had together

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.400
And as our lives change

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
Come whatever

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.300
We will still be

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.900
Friends forever

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.100
La, la, la, la...

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.000
We will still be friends forever

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.600
Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.100
Can we survive it out there?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.700
Can we make it somehow? (Somehow)

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.400
I guess I thought that this would never end

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.600
And suddenly, it's like we're women and men

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.400
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.400
Will these memories fade when I leave this town?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.800
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (It's not goodbye)

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.600
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.400
As we go on (Ooh)

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.600
We remember (We remember)

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.400
All the times we

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500
Had together

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.500
And as our lives change

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.500
Come whatever (Come whatever)

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.700
We will still be (We will always be friends)

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.200
Friends forever

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.500
As we go on (As we go on)

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600
We remember (Yeah)

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.400
All the times we (Yeah)

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.600
Had together (Ooh)

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.600
And as our lives change

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.400
Come whatever (Come whatever)

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.300
We will still be (Hey, yeah)

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.100
Friends forever
